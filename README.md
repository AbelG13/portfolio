**Degree:** B.S. Operations Research and Engineering  
**Institution:** Cornell University  
**Graduation:** *May 2026*

## Work Experience
**Incoming Software Engineering Intern, Data Lake Team @ Bank of America (_June 2025 - August 2025_)**

**Data Science & Analytics Intern, Digital Threads Team @ John Deere (_May 2024 - August 2024_)**
- Project 1: Tasked with optimizing transit times for a logistics network of over 30,000 suppliers. Conducted in-depth analysis of historical delivery data and implemented a model in Databricks using PySpark, leveraging quantile regression and a rules-based framework to recalibrate internal transit benchmarks. Achieved a 22% reduction in delivery delinquency. Developed a Power BI dashboard to enable real-time monitoring of performance metrics.
- Project 2: Redesigned a supplier database interface by developing the backend of a chatbot using the AutoGen framework. The chatbot replicated all essential functionality of the original interface, eliminating the need for manual navigation and significantly improving accessibility and user experience.

**Technology Intern @ Taelos Financial Partners (_May 2023 - August 2023_)**
- Led the CRM migration and integration into a new software platform, enhancing client interaction through a more intuitive and interactive interface.

- Collaborated with clients to reassess risk tolerance profiles, leading to more customized and effective investment policy statements aligned with updated client goals and regulatory standards.


## Projects

### Research
[Repository (Demo)](https://github.com/AbelG13/Queueing-Research)
- Developed a simulation in Python to model queueing behavior under the processor-sharing discipline, a scheduling method where all jobs share service capacity equally. This model is designed to reflect behavior in high-throughput environments such as modern data centers and cloud computing systems. Adapting the simulation to include more realistic dynamics, such as infection spread and customer abandonment. These additions will provide insight into how resource contention, failure propagation, and system bottlenecks emerge under load.

### Modeling Gender Disparities in Corporate Structures
[View Report (PDF)](asset/Project-Report.pdf)
- Co-authored a simulation study analyzing how organizational structure influences gender equity in the workplace. Developed continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) models of corporate hierarchies under vertical and horizontal structures, embedding homophily-driven promotion bias. Implemented the simulations in Python and conducted 1000+ runs per structure to study long-term effects on gender representation. Key findings included that vertical structures amplify gender disparities more severely due to compounded promotions, while horizontal structures reduce disparities but may lead to unstable representation at leadership levels. Demonstrated how unbiased promotions in vertical systems can mitigate disparities across ranks, a counterintuitive yet powerful insight.

### NBA Points Prediction Model
[Repository](https://github.com/AbelG13/2025-NBA-Prediction-Model)
- Built and completed an end-to-end predictive modeling pipeline using nba_api to forecast individual player performance based on recent stats and matchup-specific context. Transformed 10,000+ raw game log entries into 35 engineered features across 75 fields. Applied advanced feature engineering (e.g., squared transformations), and trained an XGBoost model with cross-validation and grid search, achieving an RÂ² of 0.74.

### NBA Lineups Website

ðŸš§ In Progress ðŸš§
- Building a multi-feature website that will provide users with interactive lineup building and in-depth analysis of lineup data.
